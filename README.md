This project allows you to create notes with a title and text, and save them. They can they be viewed by clicking them within the left side column. If you wish to delete a note, you can press the trash icon within the notes square. The front-end code was provided to me , and I was tasked with setting up the backend using Express. Additionally I used the node package uuid to generate random ids for each note to be saved.
